**Notes -**

Few months prior to beginning this project, I had created a notes-app using Vue. It was an extensive project, and I put a lot of effort into making it. To test and showcase my newly picked up React skills, I wanted to create a similarly comprehensive application. Instead of trying a different project idea, I decided to recreate the Vue notes-app using React. This way I get to reuse existing design and styles and focus completely on the app logic and structure. It would also be a great chance to compare React and Vue first-hand.

Over the course of this project, I was able to see the differences and similarities between React and Vue closely which helped me better understand them, and even more importantly, understand the workings of frontend frameworks/libraries as a whole. Functionality wise, both versions of the app are identical, but their internal structure and logic are quite different, with the React version being more robust and modular.

Design progression can be seen [here](./src/README.md).
