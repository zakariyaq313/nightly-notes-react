# **Design progression**

(The design progression shown here is from the original Vue version of the app. As this is a recreation of that same application, it uses the same design.)

**First iteration -** When I first implemented my version of Google Keep's design, I was disappointed with the outcome and almost shelved the project.

**Second iteration -** By making small adjustments to the note dialog, I was able to achieve a significant improvement. This renewed my motivation to continue working on the project.

**Third iteration -** At this point, the overall design of the project had been elevated to a higher level, but it still lacked the certain "it" factor that would make it truly stand out.

**Fourth iteration -** I finally achieved my desired outcome :)
